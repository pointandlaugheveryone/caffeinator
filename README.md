#### A web app to help caffeine addicts like me save money.
I created this to learn web dev, and didn't realize I have to eventually write the front-end too, so the html/css is a mess.

- Displays caffeinated drinks currently on sale in most popular czech grocery stores.
- filtering based on sugar content in case your lifestyle is not unhealthy enough :) (dark mode included)
- If you don't like javascript, you can safely look at this project, since I tried hard to avoid it.


-- I plan on writing my own parser in the future since I had to do some edits to the original one to fix errors. That is also why the files are not there as a package. 

###### used: Flask, postgres, neonDB, [pykupi parser](https://github.com/prostmich/pykupi)
