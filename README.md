#### A web app to help caffeine addicts like me save money.
I created this to learn web dev, and didn't realize I have to eventually write the front-end too, so the html/css is a mess.
- Should display caffeinated drinks currently on sale in most popular czech grocery stores.
- filtering based on sugar content (in case your lifestyle is not unhealthy enough :)
- If you don't like javascript, you can safely look at this project, since I tried hard to avoid it.

[not actually deployed yet, but... I'll get there.]

###### used: Flask, postgres, [pykupi parser](https://github.com/prostmich/pykupi)
-- I plan on writing my own parser in the future since I had to do some edits to the original one.
